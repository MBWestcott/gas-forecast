        "\n",
        "The purpose of this project is to investigate how well machine learning can predict a commodity price, given just a few market fundamentals, and previous prices, as features. I have chosen the UK natural gas market because the key data on supply, demand and prices are freely available and up to date via https://data.nationalgas.com/\n",
        "\n",
        "The goal is to predict the next day's daily System Average Price and System Marginal (Buy and Sell) Prices. The System Average Price is the volume weighted average price of trades on the UK natural gas On-the-Day Commodity Market - i.e. gas for immediate delivery. The System Marginal Price (Buy) is related to the day's highest price, and is the price that suppliers must pay for the balance of gas used by their customers, if that is more than the amount they have supplied to the system (a \"short imbalance\") The System Marginal Price (Sell) is related to the day's lowest price. The System Marginal Price (Sell) is related to the day's lowest price, and is the price that suppliers receive for any surplus gas that they have supplied to the system, which their customers have not used (a \"long imbalance\"). All prices are in pence per kilowatt-hour (p/kWh).\n",
        "\n",
        "The dataset is drawn from the five year history available at https://data.nationalgas.com/, focusing on the fields that make up the Daily Summary Report, with the data for the three target prices coming from\n",
        "\n",
        "Model performance will be measured based on Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), as compared to the RMSE of a naive predictor that simply assumes that the next day's price will be the same as the current day's price. RMSE has been chosen as most suitable to price prediction because it penalises larger errors more harshly than smaller ones."
